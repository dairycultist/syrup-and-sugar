# Dairycraft

A competitor with the Stoneworks modpack for beta 1.7.3, adding exploration, improved progression, and the mods I've
made that I Particularly Like.

### Roadmap

insanely hard RLCraft-inspired mod with an end goal and stuff
BUT it maintains the Minecraft aesthetic

accessories, copper and caverns, other magic stuff

change the food system so it heals over time instead of all at once
and change progression like making it harder to mine wood and stuff

add shields which u put in an accessory slot

pink healing crystal... pendant... accessory that gives you passive regen (stacks)

retexture chests to be darker and have an iron border (very cool looking for dungeons)

I'm going to stay away from adding structures (for the time being), instead adding cool biomes/terrain generation. Will
use my [StAPI Structure Utility](https://github.com/dairycultist/StAPI-Structure-Utility/) mod when I get around to
actually implementing it.

Unique(ish) magical overworld and nether biomes that are the exclusive source of new materials used to make magical
weapons/accessories (lots of inspiration taken from the Aether), but also filled with new dangerous mobs.
