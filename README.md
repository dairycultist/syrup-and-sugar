# Dairycraft

A competitor with the Stoneworks modpack for beta 1.7.3, adding exploration, improved progression, and the mods I've
made that I Particularly Like.

### Roadmap

pink healing crystal... pendant... accessory that gives you passive regen (stacks)

retexture chests to be darker and have an iron border (very cool looking for dungeons)

I'm going to stay away from adding structures (for the time being), instead adding cool biomes/terrain generation. Will
use my [StAPI Structure Utility](https://github.com/dairycultist/StAPI-Structure-Utility/) mod when I get around to
actually implementing it.

Unique(ish) magical overworld and nether biomes that are the exclusive source of new materials used to make magical
weapons/accessories (lots of inspiration taken from the Aether).
