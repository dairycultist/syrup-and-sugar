# Dairycraft

A competitor with the _Stoneworks_ modpack for beta 1.7.3, _Dairycraft_ is insanely hard RLCraft-inspired mod with
added exploration, improved progression, an end goal, but without taking away from Minecraft's core aesthetic.

## Pack-exclusive content

- Eating food will "cache" the amount you're going to heal and then apply it over time, instead of healing instantly

### Unimplemented

light-fantasy

no data I'll just steal code from Telvarost to give stuff textures and whatnot

adds the mods I've made that I Particularly Like.

worldgen should be built around slow walkspeed, thus dense

add cool mystical biomes/terrain generation

Unique(ish) magical overworld and nether biomes that are the exclusive source of new materials used to make magical
weapons/accessories (lots of inspiration taken from the Aether), but also filled with new dangerous mobs.

other magic stuff

and change progression like making it harder to mine wood and stuff

add shields which u put in an accessory slot

pink healing crystal... pendant... accessory that gives you passive regen (stacks)

retexture chests to be darker and have an iron border (very cool looking for dungeons)

small, non-modular structures (for the time being)

might use my [StAPI Structure Utility](https://github.com/dairycultist/StAPI-Structure-Utility/) mod if/when I get around to actually implementing it.
