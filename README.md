# Syrup and Sugar

A competitor with the Stoneworks modpack for beta 1.7.3.

Adds: Exploration, improved progression, and overpowered magic.

### Roadmap

I'm going to stay away from adding structures (for the time being), instead adding cool biomes/terrain generation. Will
use my [StAPI Structure Utility](https://github.com/dairycultist/StAPI-Structure-Utility/) mod when I get around to
actually implementing it.

Unique(ish) magical overworld and nether biomes that are the exclusive source of new materials used to make magical
weapons/accessories (lots of inspiration taken from the Aether).
